# NewCheckMyHabits
Hello World !

This is my first Angular 7 app. Going to embed it inside a Cordova container (and maybe its own browser) to deploy it on Android.
We should also be able to easily make it an adaptive web-app by using smart project architecture.

[App]
Habits manager. It should be a tool allowing the user to add data about his routins (coffee, breaks, naps, sport, ..), about his feelings when he feels to.
App will allow user to monitor these habits over time, cross-check with his feelings, and analize it *Ã  posteriori* (mb with a specialist).
In order to improve his quality of life over time, like following a Kanban-based method.

[Context]
At this very moment, I am the product owner. No code done, and no real architecture (but as a programmer, it's kinda already *pre-done*)

Real task relies in providing the right devops tools to improve my time coding, *et surtout* having less work to do next project !
